## Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!
With a background in the Life Sciences (M.S in Biochemistry and Cell Biology), I'm looking to augment my skillset with Data Science capabilties and methodologies.
This profile is a place where I will document my journey into Data Science, starting with elementary work on Kaggle datasets and hopefully expanding well beyond.
